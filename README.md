# OCS Recruitment Project

## Frontend is made on Vite+React using tailwind css and components of materialui.
## Backend is created on express along with postgressql from neondb.tech.

### The frontend is deployed on vercel : https://ocs-recruitment-project-client.vercel.app/
### The server is deployed on render: https://ocs-server.onrender.com

##### Deployed the server in the backend as it was not getting properly depployed in vercel due to some cors issue.The small incomplete thing is there was some small error with environment variables in render.com due to which i had to expose my database url which is a temporary database and thus no problem in exposing.
